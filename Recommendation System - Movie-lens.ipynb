    "# Coding Recommendation Engines Ground Up\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Recommendation Engines are the programs which basically compute the similarities between two entities and on that basis, they give us the targeted output. If we look at the root level of the recommendation engines, they all are trying to find out the level of similarity between two entities. Then, the computed similarities can be used to calculate the various kinds of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation Engines are mostly based on the following concepts:**\n",
    "    1. Popularity Model\n",
    "    2. Collaborative Filtering Technique (Content Based / User Based)\n",
    "    3. Matrix Factorization Techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popularity Model\n",
    "***\n",
    "The most basic form of a recommendation engine would be where the engine recommends the most popular items to all the customers. That would be generalised as everyone is getting the similar recommendations as we didn't personalize the recommendations. These kinds of recommendation engines are based on the **Popularity Model**. THe use case for this model would be the 'Top News' Section for the day on a news website where the most popular new for everyone is same irespective of the interests of every user because that makes a logical sense because News is a generalized thing and it has got nothing to do with your likeliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering Techniques\n",
    "***\n",
    "**User Based Collaborative Filetering**\n",
    "\n",
    "In user based collaborative filtering, we find out the similarity score between the two users. On the basis of similarity score, we recommend the items bought/liked by one user to other user assuing that he might like these items on the basis of similarity. This will be more clear when we go ahead and implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Based Filtering**\n",
    "\n",
    "In user based filtering technique, we saw that we recommend items to a used based on the similarity score between two users where it does not matter whether the items were of a similar type. But, in this tehchnique out interest is in the content rather than the users. Here, if user 1 like watching movies of genre A (most of the movies he has watched/rated highly are of genre A), then we will recommend him more movies of the same genre. That's how this things works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Factorization Techniques\n",
    "***\n",
    "In this technique, our objective is to find out the latent features which we derive m*n matrix by taking the dot product of m*k and k*n matrices where k is out latent feature matrix. Here if we go by an example, if m is the row index of the users and n is column index of the items adn data is the rating provided by every user, then we start with m*k and k*n matrices by adjusting values such that they finally converge to ~ m*n matrix (not totally the same ofocurse). This is a very expensive approach but highly accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "***\n",
    "We have a movie lens database and our objective is to apply various kinds of recommendation techniques from scratch and find out similarities between the users, most popular movies, and personalized recommendations for the targeted user based on user based collaborative filtering."
